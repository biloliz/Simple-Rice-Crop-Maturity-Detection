# 🌾 Smart Rice Maturity Detection: Image-Based Harvest Readiness System 
## 🌱 Project Overview 
This MATLAB-powered Rice Grain and Crop Maturity Detection system uses basic image processing techniques to help farmers and researchers determine optimal harvest time. By analyzing color segmentation and crop texture, it identifies mature regions in the image and provides a clear recommendation on harvest readiness. 

## 🔍 Key Features 
✅ Automated Image-Based Maturity 

Detection Detects mature crop areas based on HSV color segmentation (yellow-brown hues) 

Estimates the percentage of mature grains in the image 

🚜 Harvesting Recommendation 
Automatically assesses if the rice field or grains are ready for harvest 

✅ Displays “Ready” or “Not Ready” based on maturity percentage threshold 

🌾 Lightweight & Adaptable 
Designed to work with drone-captured or close-up field images 

Simple and quick to deploy in research or prototype-level automation systems 

## 🔮 Future Enhancements 
🤖 Integration of Machine Learning (SVM/CNN) for more accurate maturity classification 

📷 Real-Time Camera Support for live monitoring of crop maturity 

📱 Mobile App Interface to capture, upload, and get results in the field
